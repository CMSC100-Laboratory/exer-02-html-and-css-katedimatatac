    1. Create a new repository or select and existing repository
    2. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
    3. Add your HTML, CSS, and other website files to the repository. Don't forget to rename your html file to "index.html" 
    4. Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
    5. Go to the repository settings, scroll to “Pages,” and select the branch to publish.
